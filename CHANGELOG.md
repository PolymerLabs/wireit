## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added local disk caching. If a script has both its `files` and `output` arrays
  defined, then the `output` files for each run will now be cached inside the
  `.wireit` directory. If a script runs with the same configuration and `files`,
  then the `output` files will be copied from the cache, instead of running the
  script's command.

### Changed

- [**Breaking**] Bumped minimum Node version from `16.0.0` to `16.7.0` in order
  to use `fs.cp`.

## [0.0.0] - 2022-04-04

### Added

- Initial release.
